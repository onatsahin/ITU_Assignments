<p class="home_page"> Fictional properties have always fascinated me, since the possibilities are endless. In things like novels and movies, creators can come up with amazing worlds and concepts. My favorite genre in fiction is science fiction, in which stories generally take place in the future. The thing I like about this genre is that most of the time, the works include an imagining of the future and every creator's imagination presents different ideas. In this site, I will present different depictions of future in fiction across three different mediums: movies, anime(Japanese animation) and novels. All the titles I have selected present a unique vision of the future. You can see these titles below with each work's synopsis. If you click on a poster, you will be directed to that work's page. If you click on the site's logo from any page, you will be redirected to the home page.</p>

As the elites on Earth force most of the populace into space, rebellion begins to brew. In the year Universal Century 0079, one of the colony clusters known as Side 3 declares itself the Principality of Zeon and launches a war of independence against the Earth Federation.

                            Despite having only a fraction of the resources of the Federation, Zeon quickly gains the upper hand in the conflict through the use of giant humanoid robots called mobile suits. Chief among Zeon's mobile suit ace pilots is Char Aznable, a mysterious masked man known as the "Red Comet." When Char's squadron comes across the Federation developing its own prototype mobile suit called Gundam in the colony Side 7, his men launch a brutal attack. Amuro Ray, the son of the prototype's developer, gets in the Gundam and is able to fend off the Zeon attack. As Amuro soon finds himself directly in conflict with Char, he is forced to flee the colony on a Federation ship.
