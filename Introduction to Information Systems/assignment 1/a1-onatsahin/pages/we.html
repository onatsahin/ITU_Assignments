    <p>We is a novel written by Yevgeny Zamyatin in 1924. The story takes place in the 26th Century in One State. One state is a
    country entirely built with glass, which emphasizes the total lack of individuality in here. Every person living in One State
    must follow the rules set by the government. These rules determine every aspect of a person's life all the time. These rules
    depend on mathematical and logical formulas, which is said to bring the perfect way of living. Since everyone strictly
    believes in logical thinking, no one suspects their way of living.</p>
