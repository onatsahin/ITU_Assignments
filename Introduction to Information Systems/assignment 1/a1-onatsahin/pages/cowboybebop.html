    <p>Cowboy Bebop is created by Shinichiro Watanabe in 1998. The series takes place in 2071, in which an asteroid has destroyed the moon
    and caused several natural disasters on Earth, making it mostly inhabitable. Because of this, humanity have spread to different planets and
    moons in the solar system. Since the humanity has spread far and white, the police can't keep up with criminals and put bounties on them. The series
    follows a group of bounty hunters chasing criminals to make a living. </p>

    <p>I find the setting of this series very unique. Even though there are a lot of futuristic tech like spaceships, we are given the
        impression that people are mostly living very poorly. Also, there is a total lack of government. People from all cultural
        backgrounds are living their own lives in different places of the solar system. It feels like humanity never recovered from
        the mentioned disaster.</p>
