    <p>Back to the Future trilogy is one of the most influential series in the history of cinema. All three movies are directed by Robert Zemeckis and star Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Dr Emmett Brown.
        The first movie, released in 1985, deals with traveling to the past. Final scene of this movie teases that the future will be shown in the sequel. Unlike my
        expectations, however, Back to the Future Part 2 only spends the beginning portion of the movie in the future, which is 2015. Even though the time spent is short,
        there is still a lot of ideas crammed in. The future envisioned by this movie is very idealistic. Transportation is done by flying cars and hoverboards. Furthermore,
        these machines are fueled by trash. People wear clothes and shoes which automatically adjust their size according to the wearer. Medicine is also very advanced. In the movie
        Doc says that he replaced his skin and some of his inner organs to become younger. These ideas are still futuristic in our current time. However there are some ideas
        in this movie that are actually becoming reality in our time. Like robots that serve in places like restaurants and homes, VR and AR that kids play with and easy payment options.
        The movie also correctly predicts big flat screen TVs, video calls and accurate weather predictions. The thing I found the most interesting was that trials
        and judgements were being done by artificial intelligence, which is a highly philosophical topic. Also, it is worth noting that the idea of internet is nowhere to be seen.
