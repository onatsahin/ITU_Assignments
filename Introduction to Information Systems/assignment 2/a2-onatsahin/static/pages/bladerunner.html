    <p>Blade Runner, and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049 are two of my favorite movies. These movies were released in 1982 and 2017, and directed by Ridley Scott and
        Denis Villeneuve, respectively. The depiction of future (2019 in the first movie) in these movies are dystopian imaginations. The earth is hugely overpopulated
        and people have started to migrate to off-world colonies. Everywhere on the ground seems to be dirty, with wealthy and important people living on top of
        very high skyscrapers. There isn't really much futuristic tech in this world. There are flying cars that only police uses, and some high-level visual recognition
        technology. The main futuristic thing in the Blade Runner universe is the existence of Replicants, which are artificial humans. The replicants are used as slaves
        by humans, and they are banished from earth after a rebellion attempt. The movies delve in philosophical questions like what it means to be an human using this dystopian
        setting, in which humans are cruel and replicants are just living beings that are trying to live freely.</p>
