#In this code, python-constraint module is used which should be installed. Also, I used Python 3
#Link to the module: https://pypi.org/project/python-constraint/

#The code also imports block_construction_constraint.py that I wrote, which includes
#the Block class and constraint functions I used for my csp model.

#This is the code for the first structure in the question
